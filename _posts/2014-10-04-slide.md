##All Hands  
Busnies as usual..  

##Story-focused stand-up    
Instead of thinking of the daily stand-up as a ritual for the people, think of it as a ritual where the Work Items Attend (e.g., User Stories in an Agile context) and the people attend only to speak for the work items... since obviously the work items canâ€™t actually talk.
