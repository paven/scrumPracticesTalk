##Purpose

The goals of the daily stand-up are GIFTS

There are several goals for a daily stand-up meeting:

    To help start the day well
    To support improvement
    To reinforce focus on the right things
    To reinforce the sense of team
    To communicate what is going on

As a mnemonic device, think of GIFTS:

Good Start, Improvement, Focus, Team, Status
